### Very brief introduction to Reveries.
ReVeRIES is an ANR project that aim to ease the construction of mobile games. Mobile game are very popular, and there is still no convincing open tools that would work cross platform.
After five years of analysis, we discovered the existence of so called "mobile web browser" that can be used for such cross platform tools.
Jokes aside, ReVeRIES allow to ease greatly the concetion of mobile serious games. I just think the web is a plus. This app is reveries-authoring-client, a web application that generate mobile serious web. 


### Installation
You will need the bower npm package to install the application. Please refer to reveries-authoring-server for details on node and bower installation.

For the client to run, you will also need a server : reveries-authoring-server is designed to that goal.

Start by installing reveries-authoring-server.

Then simply :
    $ git clone https://github.com/gick/reveries-authoring-client.git
    $ cd reveries-authoring-client
    $ bower install

When bower is done installing you can start the server and have fun!
